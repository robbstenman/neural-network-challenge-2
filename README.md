## Description
I had several issues with this challenge.

First, I was inconsistent in my naming convention for variables. This led to a lot of time spent renaming things and some confusion.

Second, I started using Softmax for both Department and Attrition. This seemed to work, but created some issues.  Possibly these issues were related to my naming conventions. I decided to change Attrition to Sigmoid because there were only 2 classes, which meant it was binary and thus I should use Sigmoid. However, I'm not sure this generated a better result.

In conclusion, I believe my code is correct. But I spent a lot of time making edits and seemed to change the same code blocks multiple times. It was my least efficient challenge.

## Assistance
I have been trying different Chatbots to see which works best for my coding style and experience. I used Tabnine, ChatGPT, Blackbox AI and because this coding was done in Google Colab, I used the in-system help which was provided by Gemini. My personal preference is Blackbox AI.
